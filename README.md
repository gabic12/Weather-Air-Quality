This application provides weather and air quality information for a specified city. It was created using Pyton v3.13.

This app calls the Weather API (https://www.weatherapi.com/). The API has a free plan, but it requires a API Key to be registered and the key to be populated in the sorce code of the app (API_KEY variable).

Run main.py to start the app. By default, the application displays weather information for Bucharest. To view data for a different city, change the CITY_NAME variable. In addition to weather and air quality metrics, the app also shows sunrise and sunset times.
